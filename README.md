# Bulk Discounts

## Description

The "Litte Etsy Shop" is an application that mimics an e-commerce platform.
We created an application where merchants and admins can manage inventories and fulfill customer invoices.
The application aims to be user-friendly and efficient and test our ability to:

1. Create rake tasks to load csv files
2. Use SQl and AR queries inside of model methods to retrieve data
3. Create funcitioning views that users can interact with and are easily usable
4. Consume APIs
5. Write tests using FactoryBots and Faker gems
6. Build a database with multiple tables and associations

## Summary of Work

**Discounts**

The final project was a solo extension of the group project for "Little Esty Shop".  I chose to use the starter repo for enhanced clarity and focused learning.  In this project, a discounts table was created with foreign key 'merchant_id'.  This was used to create new discounts based on the next three available US Holidays.  To find the next three holidays, this project utilized the "Next Public Holidays Endpoint" in the Nager API, which was successfully utilized.

[Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/swagger/index.html)

The project was successfully deployed using render, and worked through 9 user stories and 2 extensions.  Future iterations would combine the group project's success at utilizing Unspash API for photos.  Otherwise, the learning accomplished here can effectively be used to create new projects which consume APIs, and is a perfect segway to Mod3 at Turing School for Software and Design.
